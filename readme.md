# Hello World 2 - Angular 2 Seed

This project was a playground for Angular 2 alpha and beta releases. The goal was to 
provide a minimal reusable seed project after the final release of the framework.

**Note:** It is now running on the latest Angular 2 release version and serves as a seed project

The integrated examples are heavily influenced by the tutorials provided in **ng-book2** (see: https://www.ng-book.com/2/)

### How to setup
  - Run `npm install` in the root directory of the repository
  - For semantic-ui installation just choose the default answers to the given questions
  - Go to `semantic/` and run `gulp build` (you need to have gulp installed globally)
  - Run `webpack` in the root directory to move compiled files and assets into `build` directory
  - Run `webpack-dev-server` to run the application in development mode
