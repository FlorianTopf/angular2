# Hello World 2 - Angular 2 Seed

This project is a playground for Angular 2 alpha and beta releases. The goal is to 
provide a minimal reusable seed project after the final release of the framework.

The integrated examples are heavily influenced by the tutorials provided in **ng-book2** (see: https://www.ng-book.com/2/)

### How to setup
  - Run `npm install` in the root directory of the repository
  - Run `gulp` in the root directory to move compiled files and assets into `build` directory
  - Run `gulp serve` to run the application
